# Coin Collection
Repo for the Coin Collection Android app

Coin Collection helps people keep track of the coins they have or are missing for a variety of U.S. coin sets. Many of the more recent U.S. coin sets are supported (see list below), and the app can be used to track quantities, grades, and notes for each coin. See [Using-the-app](#Using-the-app), [Features](#Features), or [Contributions](#Contributions) for more details!
